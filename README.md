A very simple app to get the state of public transportation of the Lausanne area in real time. Based on their own web service, this is robust and do exactly what you want: **know when is the next bus** :-).

Feel free to take the code to hack it further. Or simply load directly the binaries onto your Android phone and rock TL live system.
